## Current Status

- **HDMI** ~~not tested~~ fixed in last release
- **Touchpad** is only working fine in polling mode
  - added -vi2c-force-polling in boot-args, not working otherwise. Tried GPIO pinning with no success.
- **Intel Bluetooth** does not support some older Bluetooth devices
  - On macOS12+, Intel Bluetooth supports more Bluetooth 4.x devices
- **Battery manager** doesn't work properly with SMCBatteryManager.kext (percentage not updating), solved by using Rehabman's ACPIBatteryManager.kext
  - Recompiled from source using latest XCode
  - Also works using VoodooBattery and FakeSMC, not used currently as the old ACPIBatteryManager.kext works just fine.
- The **SD-Card reader** doesn't work with the RealtekCardReader.kext made by [0xFirewolf](https://github.com/0xFirewolf). It works with [Sinetek-rtsx](https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx) made by [cholonam](https://github.com/cholonam). Opened an issue about that I hope 0xFirewolf finds a solution to make it work.
- ~~**Currently trying to fix S3 sleep and hibernation :** sometimes fail to wake. I don't know if it is caused by the NVMe upgrade, the HDMI fix or something else.~~ S3 Sleep and hibernation working after NVMe change.

Everything else works well
